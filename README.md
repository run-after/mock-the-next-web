This is a project from The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/building-with-responsive-design)

In this project I recreated The Next Web's homepage (https://thenextweb.com/).

This project was all about learning about media queries and having a responsive design depending on page width.

I also learned how to use autoprefixer

This project was checked in both Firefox and Chrome.
